# TidyData_Assignment
  
  ##Summary
  This is an exercise requiring the examination of the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0* referenced in the Readme.txt filecontained in this GitHub repository. The assignment requires me to create an .R script that:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.   
  
The .R script is named **run_analysis.R** and the independent tidy dataset with averages is named: *summarydata.txt*

  ## How to run the script
